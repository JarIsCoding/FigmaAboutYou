Figma About You
I created this using a mix of bootstrap and css, but I mostly used different types of prebuilt bootstrap classes as there are many that helps change how the site looks.

Peer Review Note: All techniques that were learned in class are ultilized nicely. Pages are sectioned out in a way that makes sense. I tested all the button and they redirected to the correct spot. The navbar is consitent. All the bootstrap elements customized and the website looks like the Figma.
